**"Get in Touch" Contact Form:**

- This HTML code creates a simple and responsive "Get in Touch" contact form designed to capture user information such as their name, email, phone number, and a message. The form submits data to a web API service (web3forms) for backend processing.

**Key Elements of the Code:**
1. Form Structure:

- The form uses the POST method to securely send user data to https://api.web3forms.com/submit, an API endpoint that handles form submissions.
- The access_key is hidden in the form and is required for authorizing submissions to Web3Forms.
2. Input Fields:

- The form includes input fields for the user's name, email, phone number, and a text area for the message. Each field is marked as required to ensure the user fills them out before submitting.
3. Submit Button:

- The submit button, styled with an arrow icon (arrow_icon.png), is used to send the form data to the API.
4. Styling and Layout:

- The form is split into two sections:
- Left section: Contains the input fields and form title ("Get in touch").
- Right section: Displays an image (right_img.png) which adds a visual element to the page, creating a modern and balanced design.
5. Responsiveness:

- The design adapts to various screen sizes due to the flexible layout defined in the external style.css (not provided in the code snippet).
- 
This form is ideal for websites that require a user-friendly way for visitors to contact the site owner or team, while securely managing the form data via a third-party service like Web3Forms.
